<h1> Francisco M. Brito </h1>
<h2> Summary </h2>
Engineering leader with 20 years of experience building meaningful software experiences and reliable data pipelines for global companies including Google and Oracle. Architect and champion of big-picture solutions that bring clarity and promote innovation for groups in very diverse roles, culminating in the ability to navigate high-performing teams through ambiguous and quickly changing environments.

I can also communicate differently according to need, and unpack dense language. See gaps and build bridges. I speak and write in a broad set of languages: from SQL to Spanish, and from UX research to corporate strategy. I can be friendly and highly specific at the same time, in order to build more than solutions and experiences —entirely new mindsets.
