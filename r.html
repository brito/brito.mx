<p> UX-Focused Front-end Lead Engineer (BSc. ME+EE) looking to plan, prototype, mentor and manage.

Fluent in UI as I am in English and Spanish: 
#JS #JSON #CSS3 #HTML5 #regex

Worked with full stack and can sling my own, better than my French: 
#REST #ES6 #PHP #Java #XML #bash  #a11y #WCAG2 #i18n #l16n #Python #C++

Objectively good customer relationship skills, sharpened by numerous software demonstrations at VP and C-levels for public institutions including airports, universities and city/state departments. 
I evaluate multi-disciplinary variables, produce several options and weigh them against technical and business approaches. 
I can say the same thing in different ways ðŸ˜Ž

Passionate about designing, prototyping and implementing solutions that are effective and meaningful; that align vision with delightful experience efficiently and on time. 

I love cognitivism, abstractions and innovative connections between language, culture, physics and algorithms.
